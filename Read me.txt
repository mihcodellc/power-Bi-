I created Wait Stats Hist and change Blitz Dashboard. 

A filter can be done on CPU, LOCK, IO, Latch

over time ie long period,
over the week day name
over day and time with blitz
dive in blitzfirst visual for query problem => time => what we have in blitzCache visual(Query Detail tab) at that time => filter with HourOfDay => Get the query 'QueryText' on the top visual
I'm planning to save these save on daily basis for future reference.
